Windows building README
======================================

----------------IMPORTANT----------------------------
This readme outlines the instructions for building 
MySQL for Windows staring from version 5.1.
This README only applies to MySQL versions 6.0 
or later.
-----------------------------------------------------

The Windows build system uses a tool named CMake to generate build files for
a variety of project systems.  This tool is combined with a set of jscript
files to enable building of MySQL for Windows directly out of a bk clone.
The steps required are below.

Step 1:
-------

Install a Windows C++ compiler.  If you don't have one, you can use
the free compiler "Visual C++ 2005 express edition", which from Cmake
point of view is same as Visual studio 8:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/

Step 2
------
Download and install CMake 2.2.  It can be downloaded from
http://www.cmake.org.

Once it is installed, modify your path to make sure you can execute the cmake
binary.

Step 3
------
Download and install bison for Windows.  It can be downloaded from
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm.  Please download using
the link named "Complete package, excluding sources".  This includes an
installer that will install bison.  After the installer finishes, modify
your path so that you can execute bison.

(As an alternative you can take the sql_yacc.yy and sql_yacc.h files from a
matching mysql tar distribution and drop them into the sql directory just
before you start the build)

Step 4
------
Clone your bk tree to any location you like.

Step 5
------
From the root of your installation directory, execute the command:

win\configure <options>

The options right now are:

    WITH_INNOBASE_STORAGE_ENGINE         Enable particular storage engines
    WITH_PARTITION_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_ARCHIVE_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_BLACKHOLE_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_EXAMPLE_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_FALCON_STORAGE_ENGINE
    WITH_FEDERATED_STORAGE_ENGINE
    MYSQL_SERVER_SUFFIX=<suffix>         Server suffix, default none
    COMPILATION_COMMENT=<comment>        Server comment, default "Source distribution"
    MYSQL_TCP_PORT=<port>                Server port, default 3306
    CYBOZU                               Default character set is UTF8
    EMBED_MANIFESTS                      Embed custom manifests into final exes, otherwise VS
                                         default will be used. (Note - This option should only be
                                         used by MySQL AB.)
    WITH_EMBEDDED_SERVER                 Configure solution to produce libmysqld.dll
                                         and the static mysqlserver.lib 
                                
So the command line could look like:

win\configure WITH_INNOBASE_STORAGE_ENGINE WITH_PARTITION_STORAGE_ENGINE MYSQL_SERVER_SUFFIX=-pro

Step 6
------

From the root of your installation directory/bk clone, execute one of
the batch files to generate the type of project files you desire.

For Visual Studio 8 (or Visual C++ 2005 express edition), do win\build-vs8.
For Visual Studio 7.1, do win\build-vs71.

We will support building with nmake in the near future.

Step 7
------
From the root of your bk clone, start your build.

For Visual Studio, execute mysql.sln.  This will start the IDE
and you can click the build solution menu option.

Current issues
--------------
1. After changing configuration (eg. adding or removing a storage engine), it
may be necessary to clean the build tree to remove any stale objects.

2. To use Visual C++ Express Edition you also need to install the Platform SDK.
Please see this link: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/
At step 5 you only need to add the libraries advapi32.lib and user32.lib to
the file "corewin_express.vsprops" in order to avoid link errors.
